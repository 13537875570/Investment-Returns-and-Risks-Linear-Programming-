Run the file P3LPTestS1S2.java or P3LPTestS4S5.java so that you can get the results. 

Make sure that the java files are all put in the folder called "app" or the code may not work. 

P3LPTestS1S2.java runs the case of S1 and S2; P3LPTestS4S5.java runs the case of S4 and S5. 

Of course, you can change the size and coefficients of the Linear Programming when you see"You can make change" in the java files. But do not change P3LP.java.
